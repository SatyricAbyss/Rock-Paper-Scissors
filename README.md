# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a small Rock Paper Scissors game I made in 30 minutes to test my knowledge of javascript while learning it. See this as a nice entry.

### How to play?
Very simple! It's been added to my website demos for my starting studio. Simply go to https://meltingcorestudios.com/pages/demos/r-p-s/ where you can also Save, Load and Reset your data. Do not worry, the data is stored to your LocalStorage, meaning it's only saved to the device + browser you're currently playing with.
