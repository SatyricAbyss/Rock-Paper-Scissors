# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a small Rock Paper Scissors game I made in 30 minutes to test my knowledge of javascript while learning it. See this as a nice entry.

## 2 ways to load the game
There are 2 ways to load the game, because there are 2 files. Both files actually do the exact same, but there's 1 difference (if the name doesn't tell you what that is...).

You can actually use the singleGameFile to play it on your phone, tablet, or any device in which you don't want to extract the files. It contains all the code (but isn't as clean as the file structured one).

# How to play?
### PC
Drag and drop the html file on your browser OR right click it and select 'open in browser'.
### Not PC
Simply open the html file in browser.
